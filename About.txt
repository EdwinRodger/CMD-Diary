Hi! I am Edwin Rodger, 17 years old.
I always wanted to make a application,
as I am learning about python in school
I thought to make a simple pyhton
application. Now what is more good than
a total offline diary\journal which runs
on command prompt and has a pretty good UI

This is my first ever project so there are
too many mistakes and I apologize for that.
Besides mistakes, feel free to review the
code and run the apllication.
