Yes this gui update will come with name change because it won't be using command line or terminal as it's main UI instead it is designed using many Tkinter modules but it's main purpose remains same, write an entry in a simple, minimalistic and easy way -
1. Write a title
2. Write the body and
3. Boom your entry is complete

You can -
- Write entries (obviously, duh!)
- Navigate to other day entries with use of calendar (looks pretty neat!)
- Edit entries anytime and it will be stored and saved at that time, no need to save it manually ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

Use it to write your different experiences in one place<br>
Write as many entries as you want until you run out of space on your computer
