# Features that won't be added in MyArchives

Feature - Bold and Italics

Reason - Tkinter doesn't save modified texts i.e. bold and italics texts

Feature - Images in entry box

Reason - Images can't be saved in a text file and json file and if converted, it won't look good

Feature - Multiple entries per day

Reason - Saving multiple entries will affect saving and backup settings for previous versions
